The deprecation period for `scope` as a type constraint on interface declarations has ended.

Starting with this release, using `scope` as a type constraint on `interface`
declarations will result in a compiler error.

scope interface I { }  // Error: `scope` as a type constraint is obsolete.  Use `scope` at the usage site.
