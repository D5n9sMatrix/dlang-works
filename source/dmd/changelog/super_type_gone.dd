Usage of `this` and `super` as types has been removed

Prior to this release, using `this` or `super` as a type resulted in a compiler
error suggesting to use `typeof(this)` or `typeof(super)` instead. This has now
been completely removed from the language, and the parser won't recognize this
wrong code anymore.
