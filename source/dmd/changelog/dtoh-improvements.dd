Improvements for the C++ header generation

The following features/bugfixes/improvements were implemented for the
experimental C++ header generator:

- The implicitly generated context pointer for nested aggregates is now
  emitted as `outer` instead of `this`
- Explicit mangling via `pragma(mangle, "...")` is partially supported for
  functions / variables. The mangling is used as the identifier of `extern(C)`
  declarations because C doesn't mangle declaration names. `extern(C++)`
  declarations are ignored because there's no portable alternative for C++.
- Emits destructors not easily accessible from C++ (e.g. `extern(D)`) as private
  members, preventing the creation of instances that would not be destroyed
  on the C++ side.
- No longer generates `extern(C)` functions in aggregates that are emitted
  with D mangling.

Note: The header generator is still considered experimental, so please submit
      any bugs encountered to [the bug tracker](https://issues.dlang.org).
