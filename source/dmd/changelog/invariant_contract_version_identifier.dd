Support contract invariant version identifier.

Sometimes it is useful to compile code only when invariants are enabled. This
feature provides the reserved version identifier D_Invariants which evaluates to
true or false when invariants are compiled in or not respectively.

bool hit;

class Foo
{
    this() {}
    invariant { hit = true; }
}

void main()
{
    cast(void) new Foo();

    version(D_Invariants) assert(hit); // runs if invariants are compiled in
}
