# Each line is a file pattern followed by one or more owners (sorted alphabetically).
# Please feel free to add yourself to a module or create a new mapping.
# Ideally each module should have two or more owners.

# Code owners are automatically requested for review
# when someone opens a pull request that modifies code that they own.
# Later matches take precedence.
